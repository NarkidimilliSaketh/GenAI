# GenAI: A Showcase of Generative AI Applications

Welcome to the **GenAI** repository! This is a curated collection of projects built to explore and demonstrate the power of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and related technologies. Each project is a self-contained application showcasing a specific use case, from chatting with documents to multimodal analysis.

This repository is perfect for anyone looking to learn, experiment with, or find inspiration for their own Generative AI projects.
